# Left-Hand-And-Right-Hand-Detection-Using-Python-OpenCV

OpenCV is a library used for computer vision applications. With help of OpenCV, we can build an enormous number of applications that work better in real-time. Mainly it is used for image and video processing.

MediaPipe is a framework mainly used for building audio, video, or any time series data. With the help of the MediaPipe framework, we can build very impressive pipelines for different media processing functions.

Basically, the MediaPipe uses a single-shot palm detection model and once that is done it performs precise key point localization of 21 3D palm coordinates in the detected hand region.

The MediaPipe pipeline utilizes multiple models like, a palm detection model that returns an oriented hand bounding box from the full image. The cropped image region is fed to a hand landmark model defined by the palm detector and returns high-fidelity 3D hand key points.


Install the required modules

–> pip install opencv-python
